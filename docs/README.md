## Guides

Each guide has an English and a Simplified Chinese version.

| Topic | English | 中文 | What it covers |
|---|---|---|---|
| Manual deployment | [manual-deployment.md](guides/manual-deployment.md) | [manual-deployment.zh-CN.md](guides/manual-deployment.zh-CN.md) | Creating the database, setting secrets, deploying, verifying, and a troubleshooting table |
| LLM configuration | [llm-configuration.md](guides/llm-configuration.md) | [llm-configuration.zh-CN.md](guides/llm-configuration.zh-CN.md) | Adding OpenAI-compatible providers, assigning them to summary/translation, cache semantics, troubleshooting |

Every guide carries the same header line: a link back to this index and a switch
to the other language.

> These guides are also published to the
> **[project Wiki](https://github.com/ituff/cfrss/wiki)** for easier browsing.
> The copies here are the source of truth — if the two ever disagree, this
> directory wins.
